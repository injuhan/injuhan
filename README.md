I decided to read the code of <a href='https://github.com/google/gson'>Google's gson</a> project to improve my coding skills.
The reason I chose gson for my reading project is because I use gson for parsing json at work.
I plan on reading at least one line of code a day and figuring out things like:
- How gson works
- Coding style of gson developers
- Abstraction method used in gson code

If you want to improve your development skills by reading the code written by other developers and talk with me on various topics related to development, please contact here.
